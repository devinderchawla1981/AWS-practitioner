A)Benefits of cloud computing
1)Trade capital expense for variable expenses -- initial setup cost is saved
2)Benefits from massive economies of scale -- maintainance cost is saved.Amazon will take care of maintainance
3)Stop guessing capacity --system shrink based on demand
4)Increase speed and agility
5)Stop sepnding money maintaining data centers
6)Go global in minutes

B)Elasticity -- is ability to acquire resources as you need them and release when you no longer need them.

C)Agility-- cloud lowers the cost of trying new ideas or new processes

D)Different ways to use cloud computing--Cloud computing Models
IaaS--we run servers in cloud as we have in our data centers.So we have complete controls on them.
PaaS e.g. Elastic BeansStalk
SaaS(less control)

E)Deployment Models
1)Public cloud e.g AWS
2)On Premise Private cloud--e.g. vmware provide private cloud
3)Hybrid-- cloud applications connected to a private data center
