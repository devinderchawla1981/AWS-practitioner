AWS global infra:

1)Region: are geographically based . Even you store data in one region , you can take backup in other regions.
2)Points of presence:
are elements of infra that exist outside of AWS regions. These elements are located in or near populated areas and specific AWS services use them to deliver content to 
end users as quickly as possible.

Edge Locations:
used as nodes of a global content delivery network.
Located globally at over 400 different locations.
Allow AWS to serve content from locations closest to users.

3)Availibility zones
If we need high uptime then by taking advantage of multiple AZ within a single region we can make sure application will not go down if just one data center has a problem.
